@abstract:

	The increasing digitization of music collections and the
	availability of a variety of analytical tools are opening
	up research perspectives for both statistical music analysis
	and corpus-based research. However, as seen in the case of
	the Essen Folksong Collection, this type of research has
	gained relatively little interest. The data made
	available—approximately 5<div class="comma"></div>300 monophonic
	tunes from Germanic regions encoded in EsAC format and
	converted to Humdrum—has been primarily used by researchers
	in cognitive musicology or Music Information Retrieval
	(MIR).

	One of the key reasons for this limited use is the complicated
	process of acquiring the relevant digital competencies,
	which are non-specific to traditional musicology. Additionally,
	the specifics of the encoding format dictate the choice of
	tools, narrowing the possibility of finding comparable
	corpora for analysis. As a result, many digitized music
	corpora remain underutilized, often only analyzed by their
	creators or not used at all, either due to technical
	limitations or language barriers.

	This paper addresses these challenges by demonstrating how
	to overcome linguistic and technical barriers through data
	visualization and diagrammatic analysis. It presents an
	initial draft of an interactive analytical interface designed
	according to a user-centered approach, enabling traditional
	musicologists to explore large music corpora and draw initial
	conclusions about their subsets. The essence of the interface
	lies in allowing users to browse music databases on two
	levels: close reading (detailed analysis of single tunes)
	and distant reading (broad analysis of entire corpora or
	user-defined subsets).  This approach provides a multi-layered
	but accessible overview of the database, allowing for the
	classification and comparison of its subsets.

	The interface is built around customizable dashboards that
	present coupled diagrams visualizing the results of melodic,
	rhythmic, and text analyses. Users can define up to three
	subsets of the corpus, compare them, and filter data based
	on set parameters. For close reading, the analysis can be
	further narrowed to phrases, measures, or motifs. The
	interactive elements, including filters and range-limiting
	sliders, allow users to view the corpus from various
	perspectives without requiring advanced technical skills.

	The potential of this diagrammatic approach to music analysis
	is significant, as it can increase interest in existing
	collections and unlock the potential for comparative research.
	Presenting analytical results through diagrams makes the
	data easier to interpret, and the interface's interactive
	design enables users to adjust their views to suit different
	research goals.

	The paper is divided into two case studies: a statistical
	music analysis performed using HumdrumR software
	(https://computational-cognitive-musicology-lab.github.io/humdrumR)
	on Oskar Kolberg's Opera Omnia (19,000 Polish folk tunes),
	and a text analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	methods applied to 2,000 monophonic tunes from the Essen
	Folksong Collection, carried out using the R programming
	language.  These examples showcase the practical application
	of the proposed interface and its ability to facilitate
	detailed exploration of large music-text corpora.
