	In one of the earliest studies employing a computer to explore
	collections of musical data, Bertrand Bronson wrote in 1949 that
	"scholars in the fields of the Humanities are habitually (and
	properly) afraid of statistical machinery." Nevertheless, research
	in the following decades saw a growth in research questions aimed
	at using the computer as a way of exploring questions of musical
	style, authorship, and performance analysis, among others.  Scholars
	doing this work in the "mainframe era" were faced with many of the
	same questions we face today with corpus studiesâ€“questions of
	notation, representative corpora, the construction of tools, etc.

	Using both archival and interview material, this talk discusses the
	complexities and problems faced by the scholars who attempted to
	represent musical data in a computationally searchable form, what
	caused certain initiatives to succeed, and what caused others to
	fail. I argue that an ahistorical approach to many of these issues
	in the current fields of corpus studies and computational musicology
	has sometimes contributed to a sort of intellectual stasis, and
	that by understanding the long history of analytical dilemmas and
	decisions faced by scholars of previous generations, we might be
	better equipped to push the field into new and more exciting
	directions.
