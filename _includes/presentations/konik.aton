@abstract:

	The EU-funded project "Polish Music Heritage in Open Access,"
	led by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, digitally preserves
	and provides free access to Polandâ€™s 16th- to 19th-century
	musical sources. In collaboration with nine archives, the
	project digitized over 500,000 pages of music, now accessible
	at <a target="_blank"
	href="https://polish.musicsources.pl">polish.musicsources.pl</a>.
	Additionally, over 7,000 compositions were transcribed into
	digital scores in the Humdrum format for modern editions,
	content searchability, and computational analysis, available
	at <a target="_blank"
	href="https://polishscores.org">polishscores.org</a>.

	A major focus of the project was producing diplomatic
	transcriptions that accurately represent original notations,
	including all historical notational conventions, errors,
	and idiosyncrasies. To meet the project's ambitious goal
	of transcribing over 6,000 scores, detailed and specific
	editorial guidelines had to be developed. The team included
	specialists in early music, instrumentalists, and conductors.
	The transcription workflow was managed using a Git-based
	system that organized files and validated editorial work.
	Real-time collaboration between editors was facilitated
	through an online platform where paleographical and editorial
	issues were discussed.

	The digital scores, organized by source archive and available
	under a CC-BY-4.0 license, are hosted on GitHub and
	downloadable in multiple formats such as MEI, MusicXML,
	MIDI, and PDF. This project has greatly enhanced the
	accessibility of Polish musical heritage for musicians,
	scholars, and the general public worldwide.
