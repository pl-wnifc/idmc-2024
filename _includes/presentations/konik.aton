@abstract:

	The EU-funded project "Polish Music Heritage in Open Access",
	led by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, aims to digitally
	preserve and provide free access to Polandâ€™s 16th- to
	19th-century musical sources. In collaboration with nine
	archives, the project digitised over 500,000 pages of music,
	now accessible at https://polish.musicsources.pl.  In
	addition, over 7,000 compositions were transcribed into
	digital scores using the Humdrum format, enabling modern
	editions, content searchability, and computational analysis,
	available at https://polishscores.org.

	A key focus of the project was producing diplomatic
	transcriptions that faithfully preserved the original
	notations, capturing all historical notational conventions,
	errors, and idiosyncrasies. To meet the ambitious goal of
	transcribing over 6,000 scores, detailed and specific
	editorial guidelines had to be developed. The project team
	included specialists in early music, instrumentalists, and
	conductors.  The transcription workflow was managed using
	a Git-based system, which organised files and validated
	editorial work.  An online platform facilitated real-time
	collaboration among editors, allowing for discussion of
	paleographical and editorial issues.

	The digital scores, organised by source archive and licensed
	under CC-BY-4.0, are hosted on GitHub and available for
	download in various formats, including MEI, MusicXML, MIDI,
	and PDF. This project has significantly improved the
	accessibility of Polish musical heritage, benefiting
	musicians, scholars, and the general public worldwide.
