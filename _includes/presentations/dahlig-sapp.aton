	EsAC (Essener Assoziativ Code), one of the oldest music
	encoding formats still in use today, was developed in the
	1980s at the University of Essen by Helmut Schaffrath.
	Widely recognized in digital musicology for the dataset
	commonly referred to as the Essen Folksong Collection from
	this time, the code still remains in active use at The
	Institute of Art of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw
	for inputting extensive musical resources that form an
	important part of Poland's national cultural heritage.

	The core of the Polish EsAC resource is a collection based
	on songs and ethnographic documentation gathered by Oskar
	Kolberg (1814â€“1896), comprising over 20,000 musical records.
	This extensive collection offers invaluable comparative
	material for research across Europe, such as the study of
	musical themes in European ballads, individual genres of
	musical folklore, tonal structures, rhythmic patterns, and
	more. It also opens new pathways for exploring the relationship
	between composers' works and musical folklore, especially
	as the EsAC database continues to expand with additional
	sources.

	Alongside the development of Kolberg resources, the webEsAC
	application has been developed (https://webesac.pcss.pl),
	along with a dedicated version for the Kolberg collection
	(https://kolberg.ispan.pl/webesac), enabling both editing
	and searching musical content, as well as some analytical
	work. The existing functionality of webEsAC includes reducing
	songs to melodic or rhythmic patterns, transforming scale
	degree sequences into interval sequences, abstracting scales,
	cadential notes, and sequences of accented notes, as well
	as generating statistics of scales and rhythmic structures.
	The presentation will showcase examples of these analytical
	processes.  Users can also contribute their own EsAC resources
	to the webEsAC database.

	Given the limitations of the EsAC format, which is primarily
	designed for only recording monophonic music, further
	developments in the use of the collected data will need to
	take place outside this system. New opportunities have
	arisen from converting EsAC data to the Humdrum format,
	particularly through the Art Institute's collaboration with
	Craig Sapp to expand Verovio Humdrum Viewer
	(https://verovio.humdrum.org) to support EsAC data directly.
	This expansion enables dynamic notation display while editing
	EsAC melodies, browsing the Kolberg collection through the
	VHV interface, and online conversion to other digital
	formats, including Humdrum, MIDI, MusicXML, and MEI, providing
	additional ways to disseminate EsAC data to other analysis
	platforms. VHV also provides links directly to scanned
	sources of the Kolberg collection, useful for comparing
	EsAC encodings with the original music notation.

	In addition, Humdrum analysis tools are available online
	for use directly with EsAC data through dynamic conversion
	to Humdrum data, or with additional analyses possible
	offline.  Humdrum's large-scale analysis capabilities for
	EsAC collections, particularly Kolberg's, will be highlighted,
	including searches for EsAC melody quotations in Humdrum
	musical databases such as The Fryderyk Chopin Institute's
	collections of Chopin's music and 8,000 scores from the
	Polish Music in Open Access project.
