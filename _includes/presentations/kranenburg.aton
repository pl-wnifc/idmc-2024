  The EU H2020 Polifonia Project (2021-2024) set as its aim
  to recreate the connections between music, people, places
  and events from the sixteenth century to the modern day as
  an interconnected global database on the web, a knowledge
  graph. In ten pilot projects and four technology-providing
  work packages, we took up this challenge. In this talk, I
  would like to highlight some practices and results that are
  non-trivial and might be inspirational for other projects.
  I will provide specific examples from work on musical
  instruments (especially pipe organs), and music sources.
  Throughout the project, we continuously involved potential
  end-users for our tools, thus developing not <i>for</i> musicologists,
  but <i>with</i> musicologists. This end-user involvement resulted
  in a series of competency questions for the tools and
  knowledge graphs, which ensured the usefulness of our
  tools and data for the intended end users.

  Since the project was large, we needed a way to organize the 
  many deliverables. For this, we released the Polifonia Ecosystem,
  which is an overarching structure for presenting the more than
  one hundred reusable software and data components, including
  an explorative interface and documentation.

  Since the knowledge graphs that have been produced by the
  project are very large, we designed a novel way for domain
  experts to explore the contents of the data. We implemented
  an online interface in which users can construct ‘paths’
  through the data. These paths can be stored and shared with
  other users. A path consists of data points, but also can
  include stages in which a narrative is shared, or a response
  from the user is requested. We built such an interface for
  the knowledge graph with pipe organ data.

  The co-design approach, the organization of components as
  ecosystem, and the pathways approach to knowledge graph
  exploration have the potential to be reapplied in other projects.
