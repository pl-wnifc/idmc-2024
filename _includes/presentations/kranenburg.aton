	The EU H2020 <a target="_blank" href="https://polifonia-project.eu">Polifonia Project</a>
	(2021–2024) set as its aim to recreate the connections
	between music, people, places and events from the sixteenth
	century to the modern day as an interconnected global
	database on the web, a knowledge graph. In ten pilot projects
	and four technology-providing work packages, we took up
	this challenge. In this talk, I would like to highlight
	some practices and results that are non-trivial and might
	be inspirational for other projects.  I will provide specific
	examples from work on musical instruments (especially pipe
	organs), and music sources.  Throughout the project, we
	continuously involved potential end-users for our tools,
	thus developing not <i>for</i> musicologists, but <i>with</i>
	musicologists. This end-user involvement resulted in a
	series of competency questions for the tools and knowledge
	graphs, which ensured the usefulness of our tools and data
	for the intended end users.

	Since the project was large, we needed a way to organize the many
	deliverables. For this, we released the Polifonia Ecosystem, which
	is an overarching structure for presenting the more than one
	hundred reusable software and data components, including an
	explorative interface and documentation.

	Since the knowledge graphs that have been produced by the project
	are very large, we designed a novel way for domain experts to
	explore the contents of the data. We implemented an online interface
	in which users can construct ‘paths’ through the data. These paths
	can be stored and shared with other users. A path consists of
	data points, but also can include stages in which a narrative is
	shared, or a response from the user is requested. We built such
	an interface for the knowledge graph with pipe organ data.

	The co-design approach, the organization of components as ecosystem,
	and the pathways approach to knowledge graph exploration have the
	potential to be reapplied in other projects.
