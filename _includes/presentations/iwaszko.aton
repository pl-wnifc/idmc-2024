  This paper presents the outcomes of the <i>Chopin Heritage
  in Open Access</i> project, an EU-funded initiative completed
  between 2018 and 2021, dedicated to digitizing and making
  accessible the extensive cultural legacy of Fryderyk Chopin.
  Led by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, the project focused
  on digitizing a wide range of materials from the Fryderyk
  Chopin Museum and The Library of the Fryderyk Chopin
  Institute. The digitized objects – now accessible via the
  portal https://chopin.musicsources.pl – include manuscripts,
  printed scores, letters, memorabilia, visual arts, recordings
  from the Chopin Competition, and 19th-century applied arts.

  A separate portal – https://chopinscores.org – was created to
  host digital music editions. One of the key branches of this
  project involved the preparation of over 500 digital files
  in the Humdrum format, focusing on Chopin’s first printed
  editions in French, German, English, and Polish. These
  files offer diplomatic editions of the prints, providing a
  valuable resource for both researchers and musicians.

  Thanks to the close cooperation with Prof. Craig Sapp, who
  designed and implemented all the necessary digital tools,
  Humdrum’s analytical capabilities were utilized to build
  a sophisticated set of features for the portal. These tools
  enable users to adjust scores to their viewing preferences,
  search music by melody, rhythm, or interval succession,
  perform automated tonal analysis, and compare different
  versions of the same work. These innovations have greatly
  enhanced both the accessibility and scholarly use of
  Chopin’s works in a digital environment.

  This paper will focus on the creation of digital editions,
  discussing the goals of the project, the challenges
  encountered with encoding, and a review of the most
  important functionalities. By detailing these aspects, it
  highlights the potential of digital editions to support
  both academic research and public engagement with Chopin’s
  music.
