@abstract:

	This paper presents the outcomes of the <i>Chopin Heritage
	in Open Access</i> project, an EU-funded initiative completed
	between 2018 and 2021, dedicated to digitizing and making
	accessible the extensive cultural legacy of Fryderyk Chopin.
	Led by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, the project focused
	on digitizing a wide range of materials from the Fryderyk
	Chopin Museum and The Library of the Fryderyk Chopin
	Institute. The digitized objects — now accessible via the
	portal https://chopin.musicsources.pl — include manuscripts,
	printed scores, letters, memorabilia, visual arts, recordings
	from the Chopin Competition, and 19th-century applied arts.

	A separate portal — https://chopinscores.org — was created
	to host digital music editions. One of the key branches of
	this project involved the preparation of over 500 digital
	files in the Humdrum format, focusing on Chopin’s first
	printed editions in French, German, English, and Polish.
	These files offer diplomatic editions of the prints, providing
	a valuable resource for both researchers and musicians.

	Thanks to the close cooperation with Prof. Craig Sapp, who
	designed and implemented all the necessary digital tools,
	Humdrum’s analytical capabilities were utilized to build a
	sophisticated set of features for the portal. These tools
	enable users to adjust scores to their viewing preferences,
	search music by melody, rhythm, or interval succession,
	perform automated tonal analysis, and compare different
	versions of the same work. These innovations have greatly
	enhanced both the accessibility and scholarly use of Chopin’s
	works in a digital environment.

	This paper will focus on the creation of digital editions,
	discussing the goals of the project, the challenges encountered
	with encoding, and a review of the most important
	functionalities. By detailing these aspects, it highlights
	the potential of digital editions to support both academic
	research and public engagement with Chopin’s music.
