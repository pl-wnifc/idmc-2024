@abstract:

	New web mapping technologies have transformed cartography and are
	now shaping our digital projects in the humanities, and in music.
	In this workshop, we will focus on an open-source JavaScript library
	called Leaflet. Weâ€™ll show some projects that use Leaflet and provide
	an overview of alternative mapping software. We will explain how
	to structure projects using Google sheets; together, we'll edit a
	shared mapping project; and we will overlay modern geographic data
	on historical maps.
