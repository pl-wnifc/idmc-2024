@title: Advanced Humdrum: Using terminal tools

@abstract:

  Humdrum, beyond being a system of musical notation, is
  equipped with over 100 computational tools that allow
  users to perform various forms of musical analysis
  (tonal, intervallic, rhythmic), as well as transform
  notation through transposition, part extraction,
  proportional changes in rhythmic values, and score
  searching. This workshop is a continuation of the
  "Introduction to Humdrum" session, focusing on advanced
  techniques for using these command-line tools. Participants
  will explore tools from the original Humdrum Toolkit, as
  well as Humdrum Extras and Humlib. The session will
  demonstrate the analytical possibilities and show how to
  effectively use the data these tools return for
  musicological research. Ideal for those familiar with
  the basics of Humdrum, this workshop aims to deepen
  participants' understanding of its applications in digital
  musicology.
