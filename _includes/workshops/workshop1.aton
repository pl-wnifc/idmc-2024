@abstract:

	This workshop will give an overview of editing music in
	Verovio Humdrum Viewer in the Humdrum data format and
	useful concepts and features that can be added to digital
	scores beyond the basic notation editing capabilities of
	standard music editors such as MuseScore, Sibelius, and
	Dorico.  The workshop presents examples of how digital
	scores can be published online in HTML files as well as
	existing tools for adding analytic markup and manipulations
	of the score.
